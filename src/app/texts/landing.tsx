export const langdingPageText = `Greentexts are a distinctive form of storytelling. They originated from 4chan's quoting system that turns quoted text green. An example greentext looks like this:

> be me 
> want to train llms
> too large, too expensive
> train small llms instead
> large small large language models next?

I've trained multiple small (1M- 125M parameter) LLMs to create stories in the greentext style. Interestingly, the bigger ones do not automatically perform better. You can tune a lot of the performance with the training data quantity specificity.

Click "Generate (model, dataset)" below to try how the models and training procedures compare. You can indicate the quality of each generation.
The first generation of a model might take a while, since I have to spin up the inference server.
See the links above for details on models, datasets, and the project in general.`
