export const dataInfo = `I've made three different datasets for this project. One is actual greentexts from the /r/wholesomegreentexts subreddit using the pushshift API. These were mostly screenshots so I used OCR and manual cleaning. To augment this data I used OpenAIs GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo to generated three datasets of greentexts. One only using simple words, one with simple words and in a single particular style, and another without those constraints. \n\nFind them on huggingface (https://huggingface.co/maxmyn).`
